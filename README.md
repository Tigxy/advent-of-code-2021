My solutions to the [Advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

The content is structured in the following way:
- each directory corresponds to a single day
- the files named ```input.txt``` are the respective inputs for each day
- files named ```input{d}.txt``` where ```d``` is some number, are additional input files used for testing
- as each day consists of two tasks, there are two separate solution files ```day_{daynr}_1.py``` and
```day_{daynr}_2.py```, however the latter is mostly a copy of the first one.
